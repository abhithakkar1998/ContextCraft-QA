Gradient domain image processing, also called Poisson image editing, is a type of digital image processing that operates directly on the differences between neighboring pixels, rather than on the pixel values. Mathematically, an image gradient represents the derivative of an image, so the goal of gradient domain processing is to construct a new image by integrating the gradient, which requires solving Poisson's equation.
