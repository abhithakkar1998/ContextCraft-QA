T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a series of large language models developed by Google AI introduced in 2019. Like the original Transformer model, T5 models are encoder-decoder Transformers, where the encoder processes the input text, and the decoder generates the output text.
T5 models are usually pretrained on a massive dataset of text and code, after which they can perform the text-based tasks that are similar to their pretrained tasks. They can also be finetuned to perform other tasks.
T5 models have been employed in various applications, including chatbots, machine translation systems, text summarization tools, code generation, and robotics.
