Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a suite of real-time deep learning image enhancement and upscaling technologies developed by Nvidia that are available in a number of video games. The goal of these technologies is to allow the majority of the graphics pipeline to run at a lower resolution for increased performance, and then infer a higher resolution image from this that approximates the same level of detail as if the image had been rendered at this higher resolution. This allows for higher graphical settings and/or frame rates for a given output resolution, depending on user preference.
All generations of DLSS are available on all RTX-branded cards from Nvidia in supported titles. However, the Frame Generation feature is only supported on 40 series GPUs or newer and Multi Frame Generation is only available on 50 series GPUs.
