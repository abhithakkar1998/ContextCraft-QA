The Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) was conducted from May 2004 until March 2006 to promote and advance face recognition technology. The FRGC v2 database created in 2005 has had a significant impact on the development of 3D face recognition. Although many other face databases have been created since then, as of 2022, FRGC v2 continued to be used as "a standard reference database for evaluating 3D face recognition algorithms".
