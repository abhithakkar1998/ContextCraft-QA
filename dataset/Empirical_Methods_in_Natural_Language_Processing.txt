Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) is a leading conference in the area of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Along with the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), it is one of the three primary high impact conferences for natural language processing research. EMNLP is organized by the ACL special interest group on linguistic data (SIGDAT) and was started in 1996, based on an earlier conference series called Workshop on Very Large Corpora (WVLC).
As of 2021, according to Microsoft Academic, EMNLP is the 14th most cited conference in computer science, with a citation count of 332,738, between ICML (#13) and ICLR (#15).
